# Tic Tac Toe Game 

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java. The game is built using Java 17 and the graphical user interface (GUI) components are created using JFrame, JPanel, and JButton in IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, make sure you have Java 17 installed on your system and IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Java development. You can download and install Java from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) and IntelliJ IDEA from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA IDE

## Gameplay

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (X or O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Controls

## Dependencies

This game is built using Java's Swing library for the graphical user interface components. No additional external dependencies are required.
